# üõ†Ô∏è Dotfiles ‚Äì My Developer Setup

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for:

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io)
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
- [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

The dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which simplifies creating symlinks and keeps configs modular and organized.

## ‚ö° Quick Start (recommended)

Run this one-liner in your terminal to clone and install everything automatically:
